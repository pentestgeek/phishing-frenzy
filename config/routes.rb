	# Sample of regular route:

	# Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

	# Sample of named route:
	#   match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase
	# This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)

	# Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
	#   resources :products

	# Sample resource route with options:
	#   resources :products do
